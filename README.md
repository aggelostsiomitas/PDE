The code aims to develop the creation of the Gauss Seidle method without any mathematical external labrary , it includes the a sparse.hpp file and a sparse.cpp  that contains the functions that are needed for the implementation ,the main.cpp file runs an example of a function f 
which is the $4\cdot \pi \cdot G /\sqrt{\pi \cdot\sigma } \cdot \exp{r2/\left ( 2 \cdot \sigma^2\right)}$
