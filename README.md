The code aims to develop the creation of the Gauss Seidle method without any mathematical external labrary , it includes the a sparse.hpp file and a sparse.cpp  that contains the functions that are needed for the implementation ,the main.cpp file runs an example of a function f 
which is the $\frac{4 \cdot \pi \cdot G \cdot \exp{\frac{x^2 +y^2}{2\cdot \sigma^2}}}{\sqrt{\pi \cdot sigma}}$. The results of the solutions will be stored in a solution.dat file which can be run by the main.py file. The folder using_mkl consists of the same files but this time the code run with the usage of the Intel MKL library for better performance
